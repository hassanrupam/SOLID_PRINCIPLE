# SOLID PRINCIPLE
The purpose of this repository is solely for better understanding of **Solid Principle** for the beginners and to understand why we use **SOLID Principle** while developing software.

Here all the 5 Principles are demonstrated with a very simple and basic example in java console programs.
Each Project has it's own explanation inside code comments as well as in the **_README.MD_** files.

Each Principle has been demonstrated with Two Projects
1. **The Violation**
2. **The Solution** 

The project can be navigated through the Folders with principal names above, or you can click on the Links Below ->

* __[Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/strangerOfDarkness/SOLID_PRINCIPLE/tree/main/SingleResponsibilityPrinciple)__ -  A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.  

* **[Open/Closed principle](https://github.com/strangerOfDarkness/SOLID_PRINCIPLE/tree/main/OpenClosePrinciple)** - Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

* **[Liskov Substitution Principle](https://github.com/strangerOfDarkness/SOLID_PRINCIPLE/tree/main/LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple)** - Child classes should never break the parent class type definitions.

* **[Interface Segregation Principle](https://github.com/strangerOfDarkness/SOLID_PRINCIPLE/tree/main/InterfaceSegregationPrinciple)** - No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

* **Dependency inversion principle** - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
